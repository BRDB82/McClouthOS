in the chroot, we have an issue with reading out the cores and the memory, so we skip that part, and get back to that in the config script later on.

currently mcclouth-setup is missing

EFI: grub2-install: error: This utility should not be used for EFI platforms beause it does not support UEFI Secure Boot.
add --force => dropped this entirely, with the grub2-makeconfig because it blocked the entire installed system -> solved

new script works, except for the part where we can't set a fixed ip.
 CONNECTION_MANAGER is supposed to hold a connected NIC
 When the code is ran in an echo "[DEBUG-Lxxx]::$(), it works.
 Still debugging this.
Also this should perhaps have an extra question if software is desktop, whether user wants fixed or not, server is always fixed on the first nic.
